    <h1>Social Anxiety Overview</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>In order to overcome a problem it is important to understand what is keeping it going.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>What is Social anxiety?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Socail Anxiety is a shorthand term that describes the fear, nervousness and apprehension most people at
            times experience in their relationships with other people</li>
        <li>Some people who suffer from social anxiety would say they were shy and may have been shy all of their lives
        </li>
        <li>Social anxiety strikes people when they think they might do something that will be humilating or
            embarrassing</li>
        <li>Social anxiety makes people think they are judging you and doing so in a negative way because of something
            you said or did.</li>
        <li>The fear that you will do something humiliating or embarrassing is inhibiting</li>
        <li>It will make your self-conscious aware of the possibility that you might indeed so such a thing</li>
        <li>Who would want to get into a converation if they thought that doing so would only reveal their clumsiness or
            inadequacy</li>
        <li>Socially anxious people tend to assume their interactions with others will be painfully revealing that
            others will notice their weaknesses, that they will be dismissed, ignored, criticised or rejected for not
            behaving more acceptably</li>
        <li>Seeing things this way makes it hard to interact naturally with people and difficult to talk, listen or make
            friends.</li>
        <li>Often it leads to isolation and loneliness, and for so many people one of the sadnesses of suffering from
            thsi problem is that it prevents them from being intimate with other people, or finding a partner to share
            their lives</li>
        <li>Socially anxious people usually feel friendly towards others and have their fair share of the positive
            characteristics that other people appreciate</li>
        <li>They may have a sense of fun, be engergetic and generous, kind and understanding, serious, amusing, quiet or
            lively and spontaneously behave in these ways if they feel at ease.</li>
        <li>Feeling at ease in company is hard for them, and makes them so anxious, that these qualities are hidden from
            view</li>
        <li>Soically anxious people may have lost belief in their likeable qualities together with their self-confidence
        </li>
        <li>One of the rewards of learning to overcome social anxiety is that it enables you to express aspects of
            yourself that may previously have been stifled</li>
        <li>It allows you to enjoy, rather than to fear being yourself</li>
        <li>Overcoming anxiety allows you to rediscover or even discover yourself</li>
        <li>As you come to realise that no-one's social behaviour is perfect and everyone makes mistakes</li>
        <li>Mistakes are fine - they are only part of being human so there is no needs to let them under-mine you.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Defining the problem</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Social anxiety is normal and everybody geels it sometimes so everyone knows to some degree what it is like
        </li>
        <li>Seeking a total cure would be attempting the impossible</li>
        <li>Becoming less self-conscious can make a big difference and reducing pain and distress which helps you live
            the life you wish to live</li>
        <li>The main four criteria<ol>
                <li>
                    A persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to
                    unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny by others
                </li>
                <li>The individual fears that he or she will act in a way that will be embarrassing and humilating
                    [note: people with social phobia may not actually do anythinh humilating or embarrassing - they only
                    fear that they will</li>
                <li>Exposure to the feared social situations almost invariably provokes anxiety</li>
                <li>The precise things that someone with Social Anxiety Disorder fears differ from person to person,
                    having to do these things are always difficult for them</li>
                <li>The person with SAD recognises that the fear is unreasonable or excessive</li>
                <li>You know that the things that make you anxious are not really dangerous and they may hardly bother
                    other people at all</li>
                <li>SAD can make you feel unconfident, indaequate or inferior as well as anxious</li>
                <li>The feared situations are avoided or else endured with intense anxiety and distress</li>
                <li>It is only natural then it makes sense in terms of self-protection to avoid or escape from
                    frightening protection</li>
                <li>people with SAD do not want to be lonely and isolated and they cannot control the sources of their
                    fear</li>
                <li>People with SAD want to work, make friends and feel that they belong just as much as others, so they
                    may endure difficult situations despite the distress that they feel, and focus on keeping the risks
                    or threats as small as possible, the intensity of the anxiety they feel makes the stratergy seem
                    only sensible</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The problem must interfere significantly with the persons life, cause a marked degree of stress and have
            persisted for six months or longer</li>
        <li>Shyness is another terms that could be used for social anxiety disorder</li>

        <h2>Safety Behaviours</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Other people are the problem for people who are socially anxious</li>
            <li>The one thing about other people is that you can never predict what they will do next</li>
            <li>Like land you in it by asking a direct question</li>
            <li>Introduce you to a person who makes you feel most anxious</li>
            <li>Ask for your opinion</li>
            <li>Walk away from you to talk to someone else</li>
            <li>Your mind focuses on how to keep safe</li>
            <li>You like to keep quiet, for some people it feels safer to say little</li>
            <li>They stay quiet to reudce the risk of making fools out of themselves</li>
            <li>Examples of Safety behaviours: <ul>
                    <li>
                        Rehearsing what you are about to say: mentally checking you have got the words right

                    <li>Never expressing opinions</li>
                    <li>Saying nothing that might be controversial, always agreeing</li>
                    <li>Sticking with a safe person or in a safe place</li>
                    <li>Never getting fully involved</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Dwelling on the problem</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Social anxiety can come upon you and feel over whelming when it does</li>
                    <li>The fear of unpredictably of others and partly because of the fear of it is constantly in the
                        mind</li>
                    <li>Anticipatory anxiety becomes part of the problem where thinking about future wncounters brings
                        to mind a host of thoughts about how things might go wrong.</li>
                    <li>Apprehension and worry make it hard to look forward to events or aspects of them</li>
                    <li>Even when the event is over, the mind is prey to further anxiety, constantly turning over
                        thoughts, images and memories of what happend, conducting the kind of post-mortem that airport
                        authorities might take part in after a near miss on the runway</li>
                    <li>Social anxious people find foucs on the thing they think they did wrong or did not feel quite
                        right</li>
                    <li>Then social anxious people make assumptions about other people's reactions, including their
                        pruvate and unexpressed opinions</li>
                    <li>The assumptions made place the social anxious person in a negative light</li>
                    <li>We all do sometimes do something embarrassing or humilating, and we all have memories that make
                        us cringe, blush or curl up and waznt to hide and remembering these memories bring back all the
                        dreadful feelings</li>
                    <li>The post-mortem is a reflection of the suffering of the social phobias, it perpetuates the
                        suffering rather then resolving it</li>
                    <li>The post post-mortem conducted by people who suffer from social anxiety are largely based on
                        what they think that happened and not what actually happened</li>
                    <li>The post mortems are unnecessary because they are based on guesswork and on anxious feelings not
                        fact</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Self-esteem, self-confidence and feelings on inferiority</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Social anxiety makes you feel different from other people in a negative way</li>
            <li>You feel less good then them</li>
            <li>Or you feel ood</li>
            <li>Social anxiety affects your self-esteem (sense of self worth)</li>
            <li>Social anxiety affects your self-confidence (ability to do things</li>
            <li>You come to expect that people will ignore and/or reject you and you tend to interpret the thinhs that
                they do like the way that they look at you or speak to you as signs that they think badly of you</li>
            <li>You feel at risk of being on the recieving end of their criticism or negative evaluation</li>
            <li>You may live with a constant undercurrent fear</li>
            <li>Many socially anxious people think that other would reject them outright if they knew what they are
                really like</li>
            <li>Social anxious people will go to great lengths to hide their real selves even though there is nothing
                wrong with them other than feeling anxious</li>
            <li>It is hard for people with social anxiety to express an opinion or say how they feel about something
            </li>
            <li>people with this kind of anxiety suppose that other people are never socially anxious</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Demoralisation and depression; frustration and resentment</h2>
        <ul><li>Its frustrating to stifle parts of your personality, so after a while social anxiety gets you down</li>
        <li>Social anxiety interferes with the things you want to do and with being the sort of person you would like to be</li>
    <li>You feel demoralised and depressed as well as anxious; or angry and resentful that others apparently find easy so many things that for you are seriously difficult</li>
<li>Anxiety is by no means the only emotion assoicated with social anxiety</li></ul>
<h2>Effects on performance</h2>
<ul><li>The problem with high levels of anxiety is that they interfere with activities and with the ability to put plans into action</li>
<li>They make it harder for people to perform to their abilities and prevent the achining the things that they want to achieve.  </li>
<li>Having social anxiety may make it hard for others to get to know you</li>
<li>Social anxiety can have different effects, on careers, personal relationships, friendships, work and leisure activities</li></ul>
<h2>An example of a typical chain reaction</h2>
<ul><li>You feel anxious and ill at ease when interacting with others, or being observed by them</li>
<li>You fear doing something humilating or embarassing which you think that others will notice and judge you negatively</li>
<li>When you feel anxious your attention focuses inward on to yourself, makin gyou consious and super aware of your feelings and actions</li>
<li>This makes it impossible to give others your full attention, so you can go on thinking that social situations will be uncomforable, threatening or downright dangerous</li>
<li>You try to protect yourself by avoiding difficult things and by using safety behaviours</li>
<li>Eventually you start to anticipate being left out, or critised or rejected.  You start to assume that interactions will not go well for you</li>
<li>The anxiety makes it hard to relax and be yourself, after a time this undermines your confidence and shakes your self esteem</li>
<li></ul>
    <h2>Varieties of social anxiety</h2>
    <ul><li>My kind of social anxiety is where they may feel at a loss in unstructured social gatherings or where their role is not clearly defined and find it difficult to make friends and particullary difficult to make small talk</li>
    <li>They may feel lonely and isolated and their social anxiety means that sometimes they miss out on opportunities for forming close and intimate relationships as well</li>
<li>Soical anxiety interferes with meeting new poeple, moving to new places or seeking out new ways of fulfilling themselves, thier lives can become painfully limted and restricted</li></ul> 
<h2>Some misconceptions</h2>
